# Local Authentication Disabled Example

This deploys an Azure OpenAI service with local authentication disabled (`local_auth_enabled = false`). This example demonstrates the scenario described in issue #130 where the module fails when trying to list account keys on a service with disabled local authentication.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Before fix: Deployment fails with "Failed to list key. disableLocalAuth is set to be true"
- After fix: Deployment succeeds with `primary_access_key` and `secondary_access_key` outputs set to `null`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.9, < 2.0"

  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {
    resource_group {
      prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false
    }
  }
}

# This ensures we have unique CAF compliant names for our resources.
module "naming" {
  source  = "Azure/naming/azurerm"
  version = "0.4.2"

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
  location = var.location
  name     = "avm-res-cognitiveservices-account-${module.naming.resource_group.name_unique}"
}

# This example demonstrates the issue with local_auth_enabled = false
# Issue #130: The module fails when trying to list keys on a service with disabled local auth
module "test_openai" {

  sku_name            = "S0"
